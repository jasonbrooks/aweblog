Posts go in the archives folder, with names that must (I believe) begin with a date. For me, right now, images aren't rendering correctly. I'm not sure why. The journey continues...

Some import from WP bits https://gist.github.com/jasonbrooks/5733146[here].

A bake of the site is http://jasonbrooks.github.io/aweblog/[here].
